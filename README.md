## 📖 Project Overview

The **Text-Generation-with-RNN.ipynb** notebook covers:

- Loading a custom or predefined text corpus
- Preparing the dataset by tokenizing and vectorizing sequences
- Building a simple yet powerful **RNN-based model** using TensorFlow/Keras
- Training the RNN to predict the next character or word in a sequence
- Generating completely new text after training

This project showcases how RNNs can **learn sequences** and **generate human-like text**!

## 🗂️ Dataset

- **Input:** Raw text data (e.g., from books, articles, song lyrics, etc.)
- **Note:** You can replace or extend the dataset by providing different text files.

---

## 🛠️ Features Covered

- ✅ Text preprocessing (lowercasing, tokenizing)
- ✅ Building an RNN using **Keras Sequential API**
- ✅ Using **Embedding**, **SimpleRNN**, **Dense layers**
- ✅ Compiling the model (Loss: Sparse Categorical Crossentropy, Optimizer: Adam)
- ✅ Training on text sequences
- ✅ Sampling strategies for text generation

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/text-generation-rnn.git
   cd text-generation-rnn
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Launch the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Text-Generation-with-RNN.ipynb
   ```

4. Train and generate your own text samples! 🎉

## 📈 Future Improvements

- 🔥 Experiment with **LSTM** or **GRU** layers instead of SimpleRNN
- 📚 Train on larger and more diverse datasets
- 🛠️ Implement Beam Search for better text generation
- 🌐 Deploy the model as a simple web app where users can input a seed text
- 🎨 Experiment with creativity (poetry, code generation, story writing!)
